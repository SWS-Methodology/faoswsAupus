\title{AUPUS Groups}
\format{A list object containing 1 numeric vector.  Each vector specifies
item type groups which are special scenarios for certain elements.}
\usage{
data(aupusGroups)
}
\description{
The AUPUS logic has many groupings of elements that require specialized
processing.  The numbers of these groupings could be hard-coded in the
code, but to increase visibility of these groups (and for clearer
understanding of the code) these groups have been defined in this object.
This object is a dataset of the faoswsAupus package, and contains
defintions for all the various groups used within this package.

\details{
For an example, consider initialAsSupply.  These four item types
(tobacco, tea, cocoa, coffee) consider initial existence as a supply in the
balance, where all other elements do not consider initial existence in the
balance equation at all.

A list and short description of each element is below:
\itemize{
    \item initialAsSupply A vector of the item types which consider initial
    existence as a supply in the balance equation.
    \item reemploymentNotAsUtilization Most item types consider element 151
    (Reemployment other sector) as utilization.  However, some item groups
    do not, and those are specified in this vector.
    \item excludedFromBalance This vector gives item types which are not
    balanced.
    \item specialBalanceSugar Instead of computing the balance as the
    difference between supply and utilization, the balance is computed as
    1000 times the ratio of element 161 (final existence) divided by
    element 171 (consumption).
    \item specialBalanceNegate A vector of all item types where the
    negative of the computed value in the balance is used.
    \item escrDivisionFactor: A division factor of 1000 is used in
    reporting production values (instead of 10000).
    \item sugarDivisionFactor: A division factor of 1 is used in
    reporting production values (instead of 10000).
    \item escrSugarProduction: These cases are handled differently in the
    calculation of element 51 (Production).
    \item escrSugarExistence: These cases
