\title{Final Standardization to Primary Equivalent}
\usage{
finalStandardizationToPrimary(data, tree, standParams, sugarHack = TRUE,
  specificTree = TRUE, additiveElements = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table containing the full dataset for standardization.}

\item{tree}{The commodity tree which provides the edge structure.  Note that
this tree may be different than the processing tree, in particular if some
commodities will be standardized into a different aggregate.}

\item{standParams}{The parameters for standardization.  These parameters
provide information about the columns of data and tree, specifying (for
example) which columns should be standardized, which columns represent
parents/children, etc.}

\item{sugarHack}{Logical.  See standardizeTree for details.}

\item{specificTree}{Logical.  Is a country/year specific commodity tree
being provided?}

\item{additiveElements}{Column names of data which should be
  aggregated/standardized via simple addition.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the aggregated primary commodities.
}
\description{
After the full SUA has been balanced, all the commodities need to be rolled
up to their primary equivalents.  This function does this, aggregating up
trade and food.
