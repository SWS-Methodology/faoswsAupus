\usage{
balanceResidual(data, standParams, feedCommodities = c(),
  indCommodities = c(), primaryCommodities = c(),
  foodProcessCommodities = c(), imbalanceThreshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table containing the full dataset for standardization.}

\item{standParams}{The parameters for standardization.  These parameters
provide information about the columns of data and tree, specifying (for
example) which columns should be standardized, which columns represent
parents/children, etc.}

\item{feedCommodities}{Sometimes excess supply will need to be allocated to
some processed product.  The default is to place it into food, but this
list specifies which elements should allocate such a difference to feed.}

\item{indCommodities}{Same as feedCommodities, but for commodities where we
allocate the difference to industrial utilization.}

\item{foodProcessCommodities}{Same as feedCommodities, but for commodities
where we allocate the difference to food processing.}

\item{imbalanceThreshold}{The size that the imbalance must be in order for
  an adjustment to be made.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned, but the Value column of the passed data.table
  is updated.
}
\description{
This function forces a balance in the passed elements by allocating the
imbalance to one element.
}
\details{
If supply < utilization, the imbalance is always assigned to production (as
trade is generally assumed to be fixed and stock changes are usually 0 and
hence also fixed).

If supply > utilization, we must choose where to allocate the imbalance.
The default variable is food, but for some commodities we could instead use
feed, food processing, or industrial.
