Structure defined by O-I list (Annex 2)
autocuts modifies the SUA tree
Annex 0 defines commodities with 0 weight, these become targets in standardization
Standardization shares determined by production proportions.  If no production is available, then shares are determined by defaults in Annex 2.
It's unclear where weights come from.  But, weights are almost always 1 or 0, and the zero weights are defined by Annex 0.  The special cases are 46 to 45 (0.5612) and 48 to 45 (0.4388); 575 to 574 (0.5455) and 576 to 574 (0.4545); 580 to 574 (0.2647) and 575 to 574 (0.7353).
