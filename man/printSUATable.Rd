\usage{
printSUATable(data, standParams, printCodes, printProcessing = TRUE,
  nutrientElements = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table containing the full dataset for standardization.}

\item{standParams}{The parameters for standardization.  These parameters
provide information about the columns of data and tree, specifying (for
example) which columns should be standardized, which columns represent
parents/children, etc.}

\item{printCodes}{A character vector of the elements of interest.  This is
required to keep the table from getting to big/unreadable.}

\item{printProcessing}{Logical.  Should food processing also be printed?}

\item{nutrientElements}{A list of the nutrient codes which should also be
  printed.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned, but a table is returned in a nice format to
