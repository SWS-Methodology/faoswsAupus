\usage{
standardizeTree(data, tree, elements, standParams, additiveElements = c(),
  sugarHack = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table object containing the data of interest.}

\item{tree}{The commodity tree, specified as a data.table object.  The
columns should be childVar (the commodity code of the child), parentVar
(the commodity code of the parent), extractionVar (numeric value
specifying the extraction rate), and shareVar (numeric value specifying
how the commodity should be split up).  There are also two optional
columns: targetVar (either "T", "B" or "F" indicating if that commodity is
a target commodity, should be backward standardized, or should be forward
standardized) and standDev (containing the standard deviation estimates
which should be aggregated as well).  If the target is missing, everything
is assumed to be backward standardized.  If no standDev is provided, a
deviation of 0 is assumed.  The actual names of the columns are specified
in standParams.}

\item{elements}{The element codes for nodes that should be standardized.
These correspond to the different "elements" of the FBS, such as
production, imports, exports, etc.}

\item{standParams}{The parameters for standardization.  These parameters
provide information about the columns of data and tree, specifying (for
example) which columns should be standardized, which columns represent
parents/children, etc.}

\item{sugarHack}{Logical.  Indicates if the commodity tree should be edited
  by this program to give the correction standardization of sugar?  This is
  a hack and should be fixed, but for now it is generally necessary.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the commodities standardized to the highest level
  in the tree.
}
\description{
This function takes an input dataset and commodity tree and standardizes the
data according to the tree.
