}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The AUPUS node dataset, typically as produced by buildNodes.}

Typically, this is generated from getAupusParameter (see that function for
a description of the required elements).}

of observations which were updated.  However, it also has a side effect:

Calculation of element 58 is done by adding together element 3158 and 3159
for the source commodities.
