\usage{
defineElementVariables(elements, aupusParam, envir = parent.frame(1))
}
\arguments{
\item{elements}{A numeric vector containing the element numbers of
interest.}

\item{aupusParam}{A list of running parameters to be used in pulling the data.
Typically, this is generated from getAupusParameter (see that function for
a description of the required elements).}

\item{envir}{An environment which specifies where the variables should be
assigned.  This defaults to parent.frame(1), which gives the calling
environment, and thus should be sufficient for most (if not all) use cases.}
}
\value{
No value is explicitly returned.  However, variables are assigned
in the calling environment of this function.
}
\description{
Much of the AUPUS processing is done by computing functions of particular
elements and using those calculated variables to update another element.
Thus, it's often very important to have variables which specify which
columns are needed.  This specification can be very tedious, as often many
elements are needed to compute a new element (as well as their
flags/symbols and/or ratios).
}
\details{
To avoid this complication, this function takes as an input the elements of
interest and the aupusParam list (which defines how all the element value,
flag, and ratio columns are named) and assigns the needed variables back to
the calling environment (see example).  For each element, three variables
are created in the environment: elementXNum, elementXSymb, and ratioXNum
(where X is the passed element number).  These variables contain the column
names of the nodes dataset that correspond with the value and symbol column
for element X, respectively.
